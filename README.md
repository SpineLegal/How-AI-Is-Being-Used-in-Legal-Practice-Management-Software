# Introduction
Artificial Intelligence (AI) is redefining how law firms operate across the world. Today’s legal practice management software is no longer limited to basic case tracking or billing. Instead, AI-powered platforms help law firms automate workflows, reduce errors, improve client service, and make smarter business decisions—regardless of geography.
